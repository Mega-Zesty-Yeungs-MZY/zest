### Step 2:
- Go to your profile and click on the repository you just forked.
- **There are many ways to make a pull request, but for simplicity we will use the github website.**

### Step 3:
- switch to the branch you want to edit (in this case switch to your groups branch)

- go to the file you want to edit (make sure you clicked on the right branch)

- edit the file (hacks.md) and commit the changes

- **You can now start the process of a pull request**
### Step 4:
- Go to the main repository (the one you forked from)
- Click on the pull request button on the top left corner of the page.
- Click on the 'New pull request' button.
