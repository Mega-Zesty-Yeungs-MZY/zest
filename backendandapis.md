## Developing Frontend/Backend Application (Big Idea 1)
# Backend and APIs
To better learn about how code works, we need to take a look at what is happening behind the scenes!


## How is Backend connected to Frontend?
- fetch
- CRUD (should be similar somewhat to the CRUD we used in our CPT projects last trimester)
- Some starting code:

<img src="0.0.0.0:4001/startingcode.png">

<script>
    const resultContainer = document.getElementById("result");
    const url = "__(deployed backend)___"
    const create_fetch = url + '/create';
    const read_fetch = url + '/';
</script>

## APIs
- Use flask template to start off api work
