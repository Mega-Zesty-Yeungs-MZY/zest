# Data Compression
Let's learn about Data Compression!

## What is Data Compression?
Data compression is the process of encoding, restructuring, or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce it's size. Specifically, compression is done by a program that uses functions and algorithms to appropriately reduce the size of data. 


# Why is Data Compression Important
Data compression reduces the the number of bits needed to represent data. It is used to save transmission time and storage space. Additionally, compressed files are more efficient to process, since there is less data to work with. This makes it easier to share and access data, even in a slow and unreliable network.

# How does Compression Work?
When data is compressed, you look for repeated patterns and predictability. The larger the data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out and used. For example, Text compression is the removal of all unneeded (repeated) characters and inserting a symbok in it's place.

# Data Compression Methods (Lossless vs Lossy)
**Lossless:** Reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guarenteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.

**Lossy:** Significantly reduces the number of bits stored but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.
