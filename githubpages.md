            <h3>What are pull requests?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: black;"> Pull requests are a feature that is unique to Github. A pull request is used to allow other developers to take a look at changes in a branch located in a repository. The goal of Pull requests are to allow developers a better way to look at code changes so that they can better review, discuss, and change parts of their code before the actual code is put in the main branch. This also gives it the name merge request since that is what is being done.</p>
