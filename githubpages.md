            <p>
            <center>Github pages is a hosting service website that hosts files created from the given github repository. Github pages can be used by people like you and me to share and present their work for others to see. The websites created consists of files in the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Notice anything about those types of files? Those are the type of files that are used to build our code's frontend. This makes the purpose of Github pages to display and hold a users projects and for them to have access to their own website.</center>

            <h3>What are pull requests?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: black;"> Pull requests are a feature that is unique to Github. A pull request is used to allow other developers to take a look at changes in a branch located in a repository. The goal of Pull requests are to allow developers a better way to look at code changes so that they can better review, discuss, and change parts of their code before the actual code is put in the main branch. This also gives it the name merge request since that is what is being done.</p>
